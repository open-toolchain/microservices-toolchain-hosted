template.name: "Develop and test microservices on Cloud Foundry"
template.description: "With this cloud-native toolchain, you use a sample to create an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and alert notification.\n\nThe Catalog and Orders API are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying this application, a no-cost Cloudant service instance is created. For more information and terms, see the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-test-microservices-on-cloud-foundry-toolchain)."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to a Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment of one of the microservices. See results in the Deployment Risk dashboard in DevOps Insights. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-test-microservices-on-cloud-foundry-toolchain?task=2) for this toolchain."
